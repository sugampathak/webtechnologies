<p style="width:800; height:600px; font-family: Monaco, Monospace;font-size:18px;color:white;background-color:black;font-weight: bold">PUBG Mobile features gameplay similar to that of the original PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds. 
Players parachute down to a remote island and fight to remain as the last player standing, competing alone or in teams of two or four, depending on the game mode selected before the match.
Each match lasts about 30 minutes. The game begins with the participants flying in a plane over one of many possible maps, also selected before the match. As they cross the map, players choose where to parachute down. 
When the plane finishes its flight, a blue border forms around the perimeter of the island, marking the boundary between the safe zone and the exterior blue zone. 
The safe zone shrinks every few minutes, and anyone left in the blue zone will steadily lose health as long as they remain there, potentially to the point of death. 
The rate of health loss increases when the safe zone shrinks.</p>
